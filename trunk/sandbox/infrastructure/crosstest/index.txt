===================
docutils cross test
===================

:Date: $Date$

Testing against/with/through several python installations.

tox does this ... somehow ... trying to do it explicit.

plan
----

* setup a virtual environment with every python
* build a wheel with every python (in the venv ?)

  before build clean docutils::

    find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete

* test every wheel in every venv
* test with LC_ALL=C
* test with PYTHONPATH=
* test with PYTHONWARNINGS=default

  this shows deprecation warnings.
