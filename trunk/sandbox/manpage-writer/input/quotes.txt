a problem with double quotes not being rendered in the
term of an rst definition list in the mpv documentation:

because the doublequotes make ``Filename: ${filename}`` one argument to
the ``.B`` bold macro. 

i show-text "Filename: ${filename}"
    shows the filename of the current file when pressing the ``i`` key
